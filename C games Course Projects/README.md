# C Course Projects - Counter Strike, Starcraft, and Warcraft

## Introduction
This README file outlines the C course projects that I completed with my team during my time at the Code Academy. These projects involved creating simple text-based versions of the popular video games Counter Strike, Starcraft, and Warcraft. Although these versions did not have graphics, they required complex logic and programming skills.

## Projects
The following is a summary of each of the projects that I completed:

### Counter Strike
- This project involved creating a simple text-based version of the popular first-person shooter game, Counter Strike.
- The game included multiple weapons, and enemy character.
- The player had to chose a weapon  and eliminate the enemy character to win the game.
- We used various programming concepts such as arrays, structures, and functions to implement the game logic.

### Starcraft
- This project involved creating a simple text-based version of the popular real-time strategy game, Starcraft.
- The game included multiple factions and units.
- The player had to choose a fleet and to pick targets in case to defeat the enemy and win the game.
- We used various programming concepts such as pointers, dynamic memory allocation, arrays of function pointers and other concepts to implement the game logic.

### Warcraft
- This project involved creating a simple text-based version of the popular real-time strategy game, Warcraft.
- The game included multiple champions.
- The player had to choose playable units and calculate each turn his moves in case to defeat the enemy and win the game.
- We used various programming concepts such as pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and recursion to implement the game logic.

## Conclusion
Overall, these projects were challenging but rewarding. They required a deep understanding of programming concepts and logic, and provided valuable experience in implementing complex programs from scratch. I am proud of the work that I did and feel that these projects have prepared me well for a career in software development.
